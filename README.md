# Movie Trivia

In this trivia, you are given a picture from a movie along with four titles to choose from. You start with twenty dollars 
in game. If you choose the right option, you get five dollars. If you choose the wrong option, you lose 5 dollars.
If you run out of money, the game ends and you lose. If you can get through all the movies without running out of money, you win. 
If the game is too easy for you, you can choose the hard mode that gets rid of the multiple choice and gives a textbox only.
Be careful! You have a time limit each question!

## Next Steps
There are more features I would like to add to this game such as a hint button and a bet button. The bet button would
allow you to bet either whole or half of your money. Another feature I would like to add is to be able to use your 
in game money to buy additional movie questions. I would also like to style the game a lot better.
